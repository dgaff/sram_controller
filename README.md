# SRAM AXS Reverb dropper post control modification

## Summary

I have a wireless dropper post on my Giant Anthem mountain bike. Because I have suspension control already below the bar on the left side, there was no room for the Reverb controller to hang. I built a contraption to put the button above the bar (see pics below), which was fine, except when I flipped my bike recently on a trail, it hit and got all bent up. So I decided I needed a new strategy. I modded the controller so that I could use a small button on the grip and hang the rest of the controller out of the way.

I'm happy with the result, but cutting through the epoxy on the controller was a lot of work. So I'm not sure I'd recommend it. SRAM support said to buy a blip box and buttons, but that was more expensive, so I didn't do that.

## Steps

Here's the contraption I had above the bar. It's janky, but it worked, at least until I went over the handle bars and flipped the bike.

Step 1: Take the battery out and remove the silver mounting plate and button lever holder. Then unscrew the five tiny torx screws on the bottom.

Step 2: With precision tweezers, gently pop the switch connector out.

Step 3 (the worst part): Dig out all of that epoxy holding the switch in place. You will destroy the switch in the process. Now that I know what it looks like inside, I probably would have used a small drill bit and the drill press to do this, rather than carving away with a utilty knife. Again, this was a lot of work.

Step 4: Solder the switch onto the little white connector and put heat shrink on each wire. As you can see from the picture, I threaded the wire through the silver mounting plate for a bit of extra wire protection and strain relief. Obviously do this before you solder!

Step 5: I used some rubber spacers to help fill the giant hole left by the removed switch.

Step 6: Glue gun the cable and hole. This should provide water proofing but also ensure that the switch is serviceable in the future. No way I was putting epoxy back in there.

The final product turned out really well. Now there's a small button on the grip and the controller hangs below the bar and out of the way.
